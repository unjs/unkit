## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upgrading

Unkit uses npm dependencies with [caret range](https://nodesource.com/blog/semver-tilde-and-caret#caretflexibleminorandpatch),
 this means when you freshly install `unkit`, the latest features and fixes of sub-dependencies are installed. For upgrading we have two choices:

 - Use `npm up unkit` or `yarn upgrade unkit`: This will update the lock-file with minimal risk to the latest versions.
 - Remove `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` and reinstall dependencies with `npm i` or `yarn` this will update all nested dependencies to the latest.
